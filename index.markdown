<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Inequality. Functional Data. Semi-structural Time Series. Bayesian and Non-parametric Statistics.</span> 

  The above are both interesting topics and tools that I've had the pleasure of working with these past few years at UniBonn.

  The purpose of these pursuits has been to shed meaningful insights on inequality along the business cycle, extracting as much information from the universe of data out there, while being 
  fluid in my approaches.

  In August, I plan to attend the Dynamic Structural Econometrics (DSE) Summer School, where I can develop my skills a bit further.

  Feel free to check back. Will post some cool stuff soon!

  I will be on the academic market 2025/2026.
