## Who I Am
My name is Luis Justo Calderon and I am a 5th year PhD student at the University of Bonn, working in macroeconomics.

## My Background
I am an IB graduate from South Dade Senior High School in Homestead, FL (IYKYK) and stayed close to home for college. I attended Florida International University as a dual-degree student in accounting and finance. After some internships, I exchanged accounting for economics. I would graduate with a degree in economics and a degree in finance. I then applied to the University of Bonn for my master's in Economics, where I worked as an RA at briq (now absorbed by IZA) under Leander Heldring and at the Institute of Macroeconomics and Econometrics under Christian Bayer.   

## My Interests
I love chess (ELO around 2000) and sports in general. I actively play basketball and tennis. I also enjoy cooking and watching TV.
