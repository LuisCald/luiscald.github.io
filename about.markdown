## Who I Am
My name is Luis Justo Calderon Jr. and I am a 5th year PhD student at the University of Bonn, working in macroeconomics.

## My Background
I do not know all the backgrounds of all economists in my field, let alone that of my peers, but of course they are of measure one unique and shape our growing perspective on life and how we do things. I'd like to share my background, how my life was like, with the idea that maybe it connects with someone in a positive way or that it reminds others of the different lives that take form in this beautiful, yet still mysterious world. 

I was born in Miami, FL to two loving parents. My mom is from Nicaragua, having entered the country via coyote in the 1980s and my father from Peru, having been granted amnesty through the Regan administration. They would meet in the 1990s and together try to realize the American dream---which in some sense they were already in at the time, given the political regimes they had left behind in their home countries. They would later marry, each bringing two kids from previous partners, and having two more: my sister Amy and me, the youngest, Junior.

Growing up, I thought I had everything. I did not feel a struggle. My parents worked hard to ensure there was food in the house and that I had my things for school. It was only later on that I realized that they made me feel like I had everything and that I wasn't struggling. Seeing other kids 

According to Raj Chetty, my future seemed bleak. In terms of my expected future income and educational attainment, I would do no better than my parents, which never set foot in a college.  I loved lived in a neighborhood I am a graduate from South Dade Senior High School in Homestead, FL.  and stayed close to home for college. I attended Florida International University as a dual-degree student in accounting and finance. After some internships, I exchanged accounting for economics. I would graduate with a degree in economics and a degree in finance. I then applied and accepted a spot upon offer to the University of Bonn for their master's program in Economics. I would go on to work as an RA at briq (now absorbed by IZA) under Leander Heldring and at the Institute of Macroeconomics and Econometrics under Christian Bayer.   

## My Interests
I love chess (ELO around 2000) and sports in general. I actively play basketball and tennis. I also enjoy cooking and watching TV.
