  Inequality. Policy Transmission. Functional Data. Semi-structural Time Series. Bayesian Statistics. Non-parametric Statistics.

  The above are both interesting topics and tools that I've had the pleasure of working with these past few years at UniBonn.

  The purpose of these pursuits has been to shed meaningful insights on inequality along the business cycle, extracting as much information from the universe of data out there, while being 
  fluid in my approaches.

  In August, I plan to attend the Dynamic Structural Econometrics (DSE) Summer School, where I can further expand my arsenal.

  Feel free to check back. Will post some cool stuff soon!

  I will be on the academic market 2025/2026.
