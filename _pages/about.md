For many households, debt serves as both a tool for economic mobility and a burden that can exacerbate inequality. The cost of debt emerges as a profound conduit through which households are intimately exposed to monetary policy. \cf2 Understanding how access to credit, particularly in unsecured and secured debt markets, shapes opportunities and outcomes is essential for addressing the systemic barriers that perpetuate economic disparities and for the better understanding of consumption theory.\
\
My name is Luis and this is what I study and what I plan to study for the foreseeable future. \cf2 My pursuit is not only shaped by academic curiosity but also by personal experience and a commitment to addressing pressing societal challenges. \cf2  A current agenda on debt exposure and consumption dynamics could not be more necessary. Credit card rates have increased dramatically; financial regulation has completely displaced debt owners; and large macroeconomic shocks no different.\
\
\cf2 Entering my fourth year of doctoral studies, my aspirations remain anchored in advancing the frontiers of consumption and debt markets, all while infusing a tone of originality. Originality would stem from an intertwining of unexpected friends: functional data analysis, time-series econometrics, Bayesian statistics, non-parametrics, and modern methods in applied-micro. Spanning both macroeconomics and applied-microeconomics, my experiences have endowed me with a unique perspective and a multidimensional skill set.
