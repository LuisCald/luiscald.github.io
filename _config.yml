# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Inequality. Policy Transmission. Functional Data. Semi-structural Time Series. Bayesian Statistics. Non-parametric Statistics.

The above are both interesting topics and tools that I've had the pleasure of working with these past few years at UniBonn. 

The purpose of these pursuits has been to shed meaningful insights on inequality along the business cycle, extracting as much information from the universe of data out there, while being 
fluid in my approaches.

In August, I plan to attend the Dynamic Structural Econometrics (DSE) Summer School, where I can further expand my arsenal.

Feel free to check back. Will post some cool stuff soon!

I will be on the academic market 2025/2026.
